** real-world testing

*** optional lighter delimiters (< $ > >2 >=)
*** customisable delimiters
*** -j without arg
*** --list should respect -i (-- -t)
*** disable -- TFOPTS passthrough ?
*** error in one test should not stop all
*** don't run tests if the -w option is bad
*** don't nub test names ? (for testing $$ with multithreaded)
$ shelltest tests/add-bad-date-fails.test tests/add-bad-date-fails.test

*** unparseable test files and uncompilable regexps are counted as test failures - ok ?
