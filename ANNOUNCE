I'm pleased to announce the release of shelltestrunner 1.2. Also, in case you missed it
there's a survey where you can help steer the project (below).

shelltestrunner tests command-line programs (or arbitrary shell commands.)
It reads simple declarative tests specifying a command, some input, and
the expected output, and can run them run in parallel, selectively, with a
timeout, in color, and/or with differences highlighted. shelltestrunner
has been tested on gnu/linux, mac and windows; projects using it include
hledger, berp, cblrepo and eddie. shelltestrunner is free software
released under GPLv3+.

New in 1.2:

  * support latest cmdargs, test-framework, and GHC 7.4

  * more readable non-quoted failure output by default; for quoted output, use `-p/--precise`

  * the `--all`, `--diff` and `--precise` options now interact well

Install: $ cabal install shelltestrunner
