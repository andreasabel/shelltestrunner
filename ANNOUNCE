I'm pleased to announce the 1.0 release of shelltestrunner!

Home page: http://joyful.com/repos/shelltestrunner 

Install: $ cabal install shelltestrunner

shelltestrunner tests command-line programs or arbitrary shell
commands.  It reads simple declarative tests specifying a command,
some input, and the expected output, error output and exit status.
Tests can be run selectively, in parallel, with a timeout, in color,
and/or with differences highlighted. Projects using it include
hledger, yesod, and berp. shelltestrunner is free software released
under GPLv3+.

I started shelltestrunner two years ago, inspired by John Wiegley's
ledger tests.  John Macfarlane, Bernie Pope and Trygve LaugstÃ¸l have
contributed code. The hackage page shows the libraries it relies on -
most notably, Max Bolingbroke's test-framework. The site uses hakyll,
pandoc & hamlet.

New in 1.0:

* New home page/docs

* The `>>>=` field is now required; you may need to add it to your
  existing tests

* Input and expected output can now contain lines beginning with `#`

* Multiple tests in a file may now have whitespace between them

* The `-i/--implicit` option has been dropped

* New `-d/--diff` option shows test failures as a unified diff when
  possible, including line numbers to help locate the problem

* New `-x/--exclude` option skips certain test files (eg
  platform-specific ones)

* Passing arguments through to test-framework is now more robust

* Fixed: parsing could fail when input contained left angle brackets

* Fixed: some test files generated an extra blank test at the end
