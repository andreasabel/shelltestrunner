  * rename executable to shelltest. The package might also be renamed at some point.

  * better built-in help

  * shell tests now include a full command line, making them more readable
    and self-contained. The --with option can be used to replace the first
    word with something else, unless the test command line begins with a
    space.

  * we also accept directory arguments, searching for test files below
    them, with two new options:
      --execdir        execute tested command in same directory as test file
      --extension=EXT  file extension of test files (default=.test)

  * more robust parsing
    - --debug-parse parses test files and stops
    - regexps now support escaped forward slash (\/)
    - bad regexps now fail at startup
    - command-line arguments are required in a test, and may be blank
    - a >>>= is no longer required to separate multiple tests in a file
    - comments can be appended to delimiter lines
    - comments can appear at end of file
    - files need not have a final newline
    - files containing nothing, all comments, or valid tests are allowed; anything else is rejected
    - somewhat better errors
    - allow indented input

  * support negative (-) and negatively-matched (!) numeric exit codes

  * let . in regexps match newline

  * warn but continue when a test file fails to parse

  * output cleanups, trim large output

  * more flexible --implicit flag

  * switch to the more robust and faster pcre-light regexp lib

  * allow multiple tests per file, handle bad executable better

2009/7/14 0.5

  * show failure output in proper order

2009/7/14 0.4

  * run commands in a more robust way to avoid hangs
    This fixes hanging when a command generates large output, and hopefully
    all other deadlocks. The output is consumed strictly. Thanks to Ganesh
    Sittampalam for his help with this.

  * --implicit-tests flag providing implicit tests for omitted fields

  * --debug flag

  * regular expression matching

  * disallow interspersed foreign options which confused parseargs

  * change comment character to #
