# shelltestrunner

shelltestrunner tests command-line programs (or arbitrary shell commands.)
It reads simple declarative tests specifying a command, some input, and
the expected output, and can run them run in parallel, selectively, with a
timeout, in color, and/or with differences highlighted. shelltestrunner
has been tested on gnu/linux, mac and windows; projects using it include
hledger, berp, cblrepo and eddie. shelltestrunner is free software
released under GPLv3+.

## Installing

If your machine's packaging system does not provide an
up-to-date shelltestrunner, install it with
[cabal](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/CabalInstall) (and if
your packaging system does not provide an up-to-date cabal, get the
[haskell platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/)):

    $ cabal install shelltestrunner

You should now have the `shelltest` program in your path.

## Release notes

See <http://hub.darcs.net/simon/shelltestrunner/CHANGES>.

## Defining tests

Test files, typically named `tests/*.test`, contain one or more tests
consisting of:

- a one-line command
- optional standard input (`<<<`), standard output (`>>>`) and/or standard error output (`>>>2`) specifications
- an exit status (`>>>=`) specification


**Example:** here's `example.test`, a file containing two simple tests:

    # 1. let's test that echo runs. Numbering your tests can be helpful.
    echo
    >>>= 0

    # 2. and now the cat command. On windows, this one should fail.
    cat
    <<<
    foo
    >>>
    foo
    >>>= 0

Run it with `shelltest`:

    $ shelltest example.test
    :t.test:1: [OK]
    :t.test:2: [OK]
    
             Test Cases  Total
     Passed  2           2
     Failed  0           0
     Total   2           2

**Test format:**

    # optional comment
    the command to test
    <<<
    zero or more lines of standard input
    >>>
    zero or more lines of expected standard output (or /REGEXP/ added to the previous line)
    >>>2
    zero or more lines of expected standard error output (or /REGEXP/ added to the previous line)
    >>>= EXITCODE (or /REGEXP/)

- A `/REGEXP/` pattern may be used instead of explicit data. In this case
  a match anywhere in the output allows the test to pass. The regular
  expression syntax is [regex-tdfa](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa)'s.
- `EXITCODE` is a numeric
  [exit status](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status), eg `0` for a
  successful exit.
- You can put `!` before a `/REGEXP/` or `EXITCODE` to negate the match.
- Comment lines beginning with `#` may be used between tests.

## Running tests

The `shelltest` program accepts one or more test file or directory paths.
A directory means all files below it with the test file suffix (default: `.test`).

**Example:** run all tests defined in or below the `tests` directory with
`args` in their name, up to 8 in parallel, allowing a maximum of 1 second
each, showing only failures and the final summary:

    $ shelltest tests -- -targs -j8 -o1 --hide
    
             Test Cases   Total
     Passed  2            2
     Failed  0            0
     Total   2            2

**Command-line options:**

    $ shelltest --help
    shelltest 1.2.1

    shelltest [OPTIONS] [TESTFILES|TESTDIRS]

    Common flags:
      -a --all              Show all failure output, even if large
      -c --color            Show colored output if your terminal supports it
      -d --diff             Show failures in diff format
      -p --precise          Show failure output precisely (good for whitespace)
      -x --exclude=STR      Exclude test files whose path contains STR
         --execdir          Run tests from within the test file's directory
         --extension=EXT    Filename suffix of test files (default: .test)
      -w --with=EXECUTABLE  Replace the first word of (unindented) test commands
         --debug            Show debug info, for troubleshooting
         --debug-parse      Show test file parsing info and stop
         --help-format      Display test format help
      -? --help             Display help message
      -V --version          Print version information

         -- TFOPTIONS       Set extra test-framework options like -j/--threads,
                            -t/--select-tests, -o/--timeout, --hide-successes.
                            Use -- --help for a list. Avoid spaces.

- Test commands normally run within your current directory; `--execdir`
  makes them run within the directory where they are defined, instead.

- `-w/--with` replaces the first word of all test commands with something
  else, which can be useful for testing alternate versions of a
  program. Commands which have been indented by one or more spaces will
  not be affected by this option.

- The test-framework library provides additional options which you can
  specify after `--` (note: avoid spaces between flags and values here.)
  Run `shelltest -- --help` for a list. Here are some useful ones:

        -j NUMBER        --threads=NUMBER             number of threads to use to run tests
        -o NUMBER        --timeout=NUMBER             how many seconds a test should be run for before giving up, by default
        -t TEST-PATTERN  --select-tests=TEST-PATTERN  only tests that match at least one glob pattern given by an instance of this argument will be run
                         --hide-successes             hide sucessful tests, and only show failures

## Credits

[Simon Michael](http://joyful.com) wrote and maintains
shelltestrunner. John Macfarlane, Bernie Pope and Trygve Laugst√∏l have
contributed code. It relies heavily on Max Bolingbroke's test-framework,
[other libraries](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shelltestrunner), and
of course the Glorious Haskell Compiler. It was inspired by the tests for
John Wiegley's ledger.
