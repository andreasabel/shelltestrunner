title: shelltestrunner
---

shelltestrunner is a handy tool for testing command-line programs or shell commands.
It reads simple declarative tests specifying a command, some standard input, and
the expected standard output, standard error output and exit status.
Tests can be run selectively, in parallel, with color output, and/or with differences highlighted.

shelltestrunner is licensed under GPLv3+. Simon Michael wrote and
maintains it; I was inspired by John Wiegley's ledger tests.  John
Macfarlane, Bernie Pope and Trygve Laugst√∏l have contributed code. The
hackage page shows the libraries it relies on, in particular Max
Bolingbroke's test-framework.

## Getting started

 Your machine's packaging system may provide shelltestrunner; if not,
 get yourself a [cabal](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal-Install)
 and

    $ cabal install shelltestrunner

 shelltestrunner should build with ghc 6.10 or greater.
 Unicode support requires ghc 6.12 or greater.
 It is intended to work on all platforms; I test it on gnu/linux & mac.

## Usage

### Defining tests

 Tests are defined in test files (typically `tests/*.test`), one or more
 per file. Each test looks like this:

    # optional comments
    a one-line shell command
    <<<
    0 or more lines of standard input
    >>>
    0 or more lines of expected standard output (or /regexp/ on the previous line)
    >>>2
    0 or more lines of expected standard error output (or /regexp/ on the previous line)
    >>>= 0 (or other expected numeric exit status, or /regexp/)

 The command and exit status lines are required, everything else is optional.
 Here are some [real-world tests](http://joyful.com/repos/hledger/tests).


### Running tests

 Run `shelltest` with one or more test file or directory paths. Eg:

    $ shelltest tests

 Run with `--help` to see the options.

 The `--with` option replaces the first word of all commands with
 something else, which can be useful for testing alternate versions of a
 program. Commands which have been indented by one or more spaces will not
 be affected.

 Tests can be run selectively, or in parallel for a nice speed boost, by
 passing flags to the underlying test-framework runner.  Here we run up to
 8 tests at once, but only the ones with "args" in their name:

    shelltestrunner$ shelltest tests -- -j8 -targs
    :tests/args.test:1: [OK]
    :tests/args.test:2: [OK]
    
             Test Cases   Total
     Passed  2            2
     Failed  0            0
     Total   2            2

## Release history

**1.0** (unreleased)

  * Better home page/docs started

  * The `>>>=` field is now required; you may need to add it to your
    existing tests

  * Input and expected output can now contain lines beginning with `#`

  * Multiple tests in a file  may now have whitespace between them

  * The error-prone `-i/--implicit` option has been dropped

  * The new `--diff` option shows test failures as a unified diff when
    possible, including line numbers to help locate the problem.

  * Passing arguments through to test-framework is now more robust, using
    the standard `--` idiom.

  * Fixed: parsing could fail when input contained left angle brackets
  
  * Fixed: some test files generated an extra blank test at the end.

  * Fixed: renamed a file to make getting the darcs repo easier on windows

**0.9** (2010/9/3)

  * show plain non-ansi output by default, add --color option

  * better handling of non-ascii test data. We assume that non-ascii file
    paths, command-line arguments etc. are UTF-8 encoded on unix systems
    (cf http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html),
    and that GHC 6.12 or greater is used. Then:

    - non-ascii test file paths should render correctly, eg in failure messages
    - non-ascii test commands should run correctly
    - non-ascii expected output should match correctly
    - non-ascii regular expressions should match correctly. (Caveat: not
      thoroughly tested, this may break certain regexps, )

  * use regex-tdfa instead of pcre-light for better windows compatibility
    To avoid a memory leak in current regex-tdfa, only regular expressions
    up to 300 characters in size are supported. Also, DOTALL is no longer
    enabled and probably fewer regexp constructs are supported.  There are
    still issues on windows/wine but in theory this will help.

  * tighten up dependencies

**0.8** (2010/4/9)

  * rename executable to shelltest. The package might also be renamed at some point.

  * better built-in help

  * shell tests now include a full command line, making them more readable
    and self-contained. The --with option can be used to replace the first
    word with something else, unless the test command line begins with a
    space.

  * we also accept directory arguments, searching for test files below
    them, with two new options:
      --execdir        execute tested command in same directory as test file
      --extension=EXT  file extension of test files (default=.test)

**0.7** (2010/3/5)

  * more robust parsing
    - --debug-parse parses test files and stops
    - regexps now support escaped forward slash (`\/`)
    - bad regexps now fail at startup
    - command-line arguments are required in a test, and may be blank
    - a >>>= is no longer required to separate multiple tests in a file
    - comments can be appended to delimiter lines
    - comments can appear at end of file
    - files need not have a final newline
    - files containing nothing, all comments, or valid tests are allowed; anything else is rejected
    - somewhat better errors
    - allow indented input

  * support negative (-) and negatively-matched (!) numeric exit codes

  * let . in regexps match newline

  * warn but continue when a test file fails to parse

  * output cleanups, trim large output

  * more flexible --implicit flag

  * switch to the more robust and faster pcre-light regexp lib

**0.6** (2009/7/15)

  * allow multiple tests per file, handle bad executable better

**0.5** (2009/7/14)

  * show failure output in proper order

**0.4** (2009/7/14)

  * run commands in a more robust way to avoid hangs
    This fixes hanging when a command generates large output, and hopefully
    all other deadlocks. The output is consumed strictly. Thanks to Ganesh
    Sittampalam for his help with this.

  * --implicit-tests flag providing implicit tests for omitted fields

  * --debug flag

  * regular expression matching

  * disallow interspersed foreign options which confused parseargs

  * change comment character to #

**0.3** (2009/7/11)

  * misc. bugfixes/improvements

**0.2** (2009/7/10)

  * bugfix, build with -threaded

**0.1** (2009/7/10)

  * shelltestrunner, a generic shell command stdout/stderr/exit status tester
